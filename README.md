## 📘 Introduction

This project,CipherNest, is an interactive designed to allow user to explore and experiment with fundamental cryptographic algorithms. The purpose of CipherNest is to provide a hands-on learning experience with various encryption, description, and key exchange concepts. Cryptography is of paramount importance in the digital age, serving as the foundation for secure communication, data protection, and privacy. Understanding it's core principle is crucial for anyone involved in information technology and digital security. CipherNest aims to demystify these concepts by providing a clear and engaging platform for users to see cryptographic algorithms in action.

## 🧠 Discussions

<!-- 
o Describe the overall application architecture and UI choice.
o For each implemented cryptographic algorithm:
    ▪ Name and type (Symmetric/Asymmetric/Hash)
    ▪ Brief history/background
    ▪ Description of the process/how it works (can be high-level or include simplified pseudocode)
    ▪ Libraries used for its implementation
    ▪ How it's integrated into your application
